## How to use

How to configure kong moesif plugin:

### Enabling the plugin for a Service:

Configure on top of a Service by executing the following request on your Kong server:

```
curl -i -X POST --url http://localhost:8001/services/{service}/plugins/ \
     --data "name=moesif"   \
     --data "config.application_id=X-MOESIF-APPLICATION-ID";
```
service: the id or name of the Service that this plugin configuration will target.
X-MOESIF-APPLICATION-ID: You can find your Application Id from [_Moesif Dashboard_](https://www.moesif.com/) -> _Top Right Menu_ -> _App Setup_

### Enabling the plugin for a Route:

Configure on top of a Route with:


```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/routes/{route_id}/plugins \
    --data "name=moesif" \
    --data "config.application_id=X-MOESIF-APPLICATION-ID"
```
route_id: the id of the Route that this plugin configuration will target.
X-MOESIF-APPLICATION-ID: You can find your Application Id from [_Moesif Dashboard_](https://www.moesif.com/) -> _Top Right Menu_ -> _App Setup_


### Enabling the plugin for an API

If you are using the deprecated API entity, you can configure on top of an API by executing the following request on your Kong server:


```
$ curl -X POST http://kong:8001/apis/{api}/plugins \
    --data "name=moesif"  \
    --data "config.application_id=X-MOESIF-APPLICATION-ID"

```

api: either id or name of the API that this plugin configuration will target.
X-MOESIF-APPLICATION-ID: You can find your Application Id from [_Moesif Dashboard_](https://www.moesif.com/) -> _Top Right Menu_ -> _App Setup_


### Enabling the plugin for a Consumer

You can use the http://localhost:8001/plugins endpoint to target Consumers:

```
$ curl -X POST http://kong:8001/plugins \
    --data "name=moesif" \
    --data "consumer_id={consumer_id}"  \
    --data "config.application_id=X-MOESIF-APPLICATION-ID"
```
Where consumer_id is the id of the Consumer we want to associate with this plugin.

You can combine adding consumer_id and service_id in the same request.

### Global plugins

All plugins can be configured using the http:/kong:8001/plugins/ endpoint.
A plugin which is not associated to any API, Service, Route or Consumer is considered "global", and will be run on every request. Read the Plugin Reference and the Plugin Precedence sections for more information.
